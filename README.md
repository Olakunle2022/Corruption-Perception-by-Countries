## Introduction:
The Corruption Perception Index thus has a deep influence on the HDI of a nation, which in turn assesses parameters like life expectancy,
education, and living standards. The countries which have a very low CPI score, such as Congo and Niger, where the extent of corruption is very
high, always record lower Human Development Index (HDI) outcomes, thus showing the deleterious link between corruption and human
development. In such countries, press freedom is suppressed, allowing corruption to continue unabated, and overall bribes in public and private
sectors siphon off the much-needed resources that are direly needed in education and healthcare sectors. Social decay, which is further
detrimental to development, is fostered by this depletion of trust in public institutions and misallocation of resources. This relationship stands to be
realized by policy makers in a bid to abolish corruption and create lasting prosperity
